Chosen cipher attack is an attack model that If an attacker can gather information by obtaining the decryption of cipertexts, attacker can then retrieve the plaintext without having the key.

In this project, each student is given a public key, an encrypted flag and a source code of the decrypter running on the server. Your goal is to use chosen ciphertext attack to retrieve the flag. The decrypt server is at 140.113.194.66, port 8888.
